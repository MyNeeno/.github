# ðŸ¤— Welcome to the NEENO community!

This Github organization hosts the various open-source projects managed by the Neeno team, including:

* CLI: A command line interface to handle your Neeno devices.
* IDE: Planned to be built after the CLI release.
* Language discussions: about the possible language implementations to interface with your Neeno devices.
* API specification: to build your own interfaces on top of the Core applications.
* Reference docs: Probably to be hosted in a github page. TBD.

We value contributions and we will provide the most active and constant support to our users.
